# Dissertation

revealjs presentation in Rmarkdown for the defense of my Ph.D. dissertation


The presentation can be played in an html browser by opening the file
Presentacion.html, e.g.:
https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/DaniMori/Dissertation/blob/master/Presentacion.html
[NOTE: reveal.js engine won't work on this preview, better clone the repo and open the file locally]


To generate the presentation locally, clone the repository, install the required
packages, then knit the Rmarkdown file "Presentation.Rmd"
