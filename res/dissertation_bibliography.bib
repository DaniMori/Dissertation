	abstract = {This paper aims at introducing the R package prefmod (Hatzinger, 2009) which allows the user to fit various models to paired comparison data. These models give estimated overall rankings of objects or items where each subject (respondent/judge) makes one or more comparisons between pairs of objects (items). The focus is on the loglinear Bradley-Terry (LLBT) model, the loglinear formulation of the Bradley-Terry(-Luce) model, both assuming independence between comparisons. Five types of data structures are covered: (i) simple paired comparisons, (ii) paired comparisons including an undecidedcategory, (iii) categorical subject covariates (for estimating different overall rankings for different
subject groups), (iv) object covariates for reparameterizing objects, and (v) order (position) effects. Additionally, the discussion briefly addresses other response formats such as ratings and (partial) rankings.},

	title = {Psychometric methods for controlling social desirability response bias in aggression questionnaires},
	url = {http://www.tdx.cat/handle/10803/101522},
	abstract = {Faking is understood as a respondent’s active effort to distort his/her answers to create a positive image. Although the extensive existing literature, several questions are still unsolved. On one hand, virtually no attention has been paid to an issue considered by many authors as relevant, as is the impact of individual differences on faking. On the other hand, little has been done to examine the how highly undesirable personality measures, in our society, are impacted by faking. The present work aims to shed some light to these questions. 
On the one hand, an indirect aggression questionnaire has been adapted. New psychometric procedures to assess the moment increments due to faking at trait level, for the group and individual levels were developed.  The procedure also allows assessing the impact of individual differences on those increments. 
Finally, the General Factor-Analytic Procedure was tested to contrast if controlling for social desirability on personality scores will efficiently control for faking. In addition, the impact of individual differences was assessed on the three main aggression traits: physical, verbal and indirect.},

An application to a large sample of data for twenty vocabulary items shows excellent fit of the model according to a chi-square criterion. Item and test information curves are compared for estimation of ability assuming multiple category and dichotomous scoring of these items. Multiple scoring proves substantially more precise for subjects of less than median ability, and about equally precise for subjects above the median.},

	abstract = {The comparative format used in ranking and paired comparisons tasks can significantly reduce the impact of uniform response biases typically associated with rating scales. Thurstone's (1927, 1931) model provides a powerful framework for modeling comparative data such as paired comparisons and rankings. Although Thurstonian models are generally presented as scaling models, that is, stimuli-centered models, they can also be used as person-centered models. In this article, we discuss how Thurstone's model for comparative data can be formulated as item response theory models so that respondents' scores on underlying dimensions can be estimated. Item parameters and latent trait scores can be readily estimated using a widely used statistical modeling program. Simulation studies show that item characteristic curves can be accurately estimated with as few as 200 observations and that latent trait scores can be recovered to a high precision. Empirical examples are given to illustrate how the model may be applied in practice and to recommend guidelines for designing ranking and paired comparisons tasks in the future.},

Multidimensional analysis of simulated two-dimensional item response data fitting a multi dimensional two-parameter logistic item response theory model (McKinley \& Reckase, 1983a; Reckase \& McKinley, 1991) was done using the program MIRTE (Carlson, 1987). Six datasets (2 trait distri butions x 3 levels of correlation between dimen sions) of 2,000 trait vectors over 104 items were generated. Each dataset was analyzed and repli cated 100 times. Trait and item parameters generally were recovered adequately in the datasets in which both traits were normally distributed over the full range. In the datasets with a restricted range of trait level on the second dimension, recovery of the trait and item parameters was affected adversely. The results indicated that MIRTE recovers the struc ture of a multidimensional correlated space better than reported in earlier studies, especially when items are multidimensional.},

The present research examined a potentially important factor influencing forced-choice measure effectiveness—namely, the manner in which statement desirability ratings used in constructing forced-choice items are obtained—with the goal of clarifying previous findings and providing guidance for those interested in developing these measures. Two studies indicated that different desirability rating instructions produce substantially different forced-choice measures that are differentially effective in reducing score inflation and retaining trait-level information under faking conditions. These studies suggest that the manner in which statement desirability ratings are obtained may be an important consideration in forced-choice measure development. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR},

Exact equations are developed for the single dimensional case and an approximate one for the multidimensional case. Both types of equations are expressed solely in terms of univariate normal distribution functions and are therefore easy to evaluate. A Monte Carlo experiment, involving 9 stimuli and 3 subjects in a 2 dimensional space, was run to determine the degree of accuracy of the multidimensional equation and the feasibility of using iterative methods to obtain maximum likelihood estimates of the stimulus and subject coordinates.

Employers are understandably attracted by claims that these quick and easy to administer tests will give valid insights into the personality of job applicants. However, on the evidence we have seen, the publishers and the promoters of these tests are either unaware of, or do not understand, or are choosing to ignore their limitations. This is not to say that ipsative tests have no utility but that the claims made for their validity and reliability and their applicability to inter-individual comparisons are misleading. Failure to take account of the mathematical properties of ipsative measures leads users to treat them as if they are normative measures, with startling consequences which ought to be obvious but unfortunately are not.},

Some even go so far as to accuse the authors of ipsative scales of reporting spurious statistics and of 'cheating at patience'. Despite previous papers which claim to demonstrate that ipsative scales overestimate reliabilities, cannot be factored soundly and yield uninterpretable validity coefficients, this investigation shows with synthetic data that these generalizations are ill-advised. The results demonstrate with simulated data that ipsative scores can be factored soundly, that reliability data are not overestimated, and that under moderate conditions of central tendency bias in normative items, ipsative scores actually correlate better with hypothetical 'true' scores than the normative form. When replicated on real data from a sample of 243 subjects, a high correlation was found between ipsative and normative scale scores, ipsative scaling did not produce spuriously high reliabilities, and both normative and ipsative data showed sensible and significant correlations with external rating criteria.},

This approach derives from Likert's famous 1932 approach to the development and analysis of rating scales. In this paper, we argue that Likert scaling and related methods are misguided. Instead, we propose that methods that have evolved from scaling provide a better representation of the choice process underlying rating scale judgments. These methods hypothesize an ideal point response process where the probability of endorsement is assumed to be directly related to the proximity of the statement to the individual's standing on the assessed trait. We review some research showing the superiority of ideal point methods for personality assessment and then describe several settings in which ideal point methods should provide tangible improvements over traditional approaches to assessment.},

Results suggest that an MCMC procedure using a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm can recover the parameters of both models but is less successful for the MLTM as the correlation between abilities increases. In general, estimation is more accurate for the M2PL than the MLTM. A Bayes factor criterion for comparing the relative .t of the models to a common data set is investigated using simulated data. Using real data, the M2PL is found to be the superior model for a test of English usage.},

	abstract = {Many paired comparison data sets reported in the literature are obtained in a multiple judgment setting where each judge compares all possible item pairs one at a time. Despite the repeated measures structure of the data, typically the multiple judgments are analyzed under the strong assumption of independence. This disregard for dependencies in the paired comparison judgments is a serious model misspecification that may lead to incorrect statistical and substantive conclusions. Building on Takane's (1987, Cognition and Communication, 20, 45–62) analysis of covariance structures models, we present a variant of the Monte Carlo expectation maximization (MCEM) algorithm for estimating probabilistic paired comparison models of multiple paired comparison judgments. The MCEM algorithm is straightforward to implement and converges quickly even when the paired comparison data are sparse. A detailed analysis of a paired comparison experiment illustrates the usefulness of this approach for the interpretation of similarity and individual difference effects in preference data.},

There are two main constraints on a correlation matrix: positive definiteness and fixed diagonal elements. These constraints make sampling R difficult. In this paper, an efficient generalized parameter expanded re-parametrization and Metropolis-Hastings (GPX-RPMH) algorithm for sampling a correlation matrix is proposed. Drawing all components of R simultaneously from its full conditional distribution is realized by first drawing a covariance matrix from the derived parameter expanded candidate density (PXCD), and then translating it back to a correlation matrix and accepting it according to a Metropolis-Hastings (M-H) acceptance rate. The mixing rate in the M-H step can be adjusted through a class of tuning parameters embedded in the generalized candidate prior (GCP), which is chosen for R to derive the PXCD. This algorithm is illustrated using multivariate regression (MVR) models and a simulation study shows that the performance of the GPX-RPMH algorithm is more efficient than that of other methods.},

Unfortunately, sampling the correlation matrix in Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms can be problematic. In addition to the positive definite constraint of covariance matrices, correlation matrices have diagonal elements fixed at one. In this article, we propose an efficient two-stage parameter expanded reparameterization and Metropolis-Hastings (PX-RPMH) algorithm for simulating R. Using this algorithm, we draw all elements of R simultaneously by first drawing a covariance matrix from an inverse Wishart distribution, and then translating it back to a correlation matrix through a reduction function and accepting it based on a Metropolis-Hastings acceptance probability. This algorithm is illustrated using multivariate probit (MVP) models and multivariate regression (MVR) models with a common correlation matrix across groups. Via both a simulation study and a real data example, the performance of the PX-RPMH algorithm is compared with those of other common algorithms. The results show that the PX-RPMH algorithm is more efficient than other methods for sampling a correlation matrix.},

The null distribution of Y was approximated using a chi-squared distribution by matching moments. The moments were derived under the assumption that the model parameters were known in advance and it was conjectured that the approximation would also be appropriate when the parameters were to be estimated. Using maximum likelihood estimation of the two-parameter logistic item response theory model, we show that the effect of parameter estimation on the distribution of Y is too large to be ignored. Consequently, we derive the asymptotic moments of Y for maximum likelihood estimation. We show using a simulation study that when the null distribution of Y is approximated using moments that take into account the effect of estimation, Y becomes a very useful statistic to assess the overall goodness of fit of models fitted to sparse 2P tables.},

	abstract = {The magnitude of self-presentation that occurs in laboratory settings is thought to be more extreme than that which occurs in field settings (e.g., Ones \& Viswesvaran, 1998), calling into question the generalizability of laboratory research on self-presentation. As a further investigation into differences in the magnitude of self-presentation between laboratory and field settings, a meta-analysis was conducted. Initial analyses comparing all estimated effects from laboratory settings to all estimated effects from field settings demonstrated larger effects in the laboratory than in the field. Further analyses suggested that the magnitude of self-presentation in laboratory and field settings is moderated by several design factors. In lab studies, a trend for larger estimated effect sizes was found for studies using certain types of within-subjects designs and the pattern of the estimated magnitude of effects across traits varied as a function of the provided context (e.g., work versus non-work contexts). In field settings, analyses revealed a trend for larger self-presentation effects when applicant and incumbent samples are equivalent as compared to samples that are not equivalent. After accounting for moderator variables in lab and field settings, there were no systematic differences between lab and field studies. These results do not support the assumption that the magnitude of self-presentation that occurs in the lab overestimates that which occurs in the field. Differences in the magnitude of self-presentation in lab and field settings may be artifacts of differences in design choices across these two settings. Furthermore, the magnitude of self-presentation estimated is moderate to large in both settings. Implications for future self-presentation research are discussed.},

	abstract = {In selection research and practice, there have been many attempts to correct scores on noncognitive measures for applicants who may have faked their responses somehow. A related approach with more impact would be identifying and removing faking applicants from consideration for employment entirely, replacing them with high-scoring alternatives. The current study demonstrates that under typical conditions found in selection, even this latter approach has minimal impact on mean performance levels. Results indicate about .1 SD change in mean performance across a range of typical correlations between a faking measure and the criterion. Where trait scores were corrected only for suspected faking, and applicants not removed or replaced, the minimal impact the authors found on mean performance was reduced even further. By comparison, the impact of selection ratio and test validity is much larger across a range of realistic levels of selection ratios and validities. If selection researchers are interested only in maximizing predicted performance or validity, the use of faking measures to correct scores or remove applicants from further employment consideration will produce minimal effects.},

	title = {A new item response theory model for estimating person ability and item parameters for multidimensional rank order responses},
	url = {http://scholarcommons.usf.edu/etd/4942},
	abstract = {The assessment of noncognitive constructs poses a number of challenges that set it apart from traditional cognitive ability measurement. Of particular concern is the influence of response biases and response styles that can influence the accuracy of scale scores. One strategy to address these concerns is to use alternative item presentation formats (such as multidimensional forced choice (MFC) pairs, triads, and tetrads) that may provide resistance to such biases. A variety of strategies for constructing and scoring these forced choice measured have been proposed, though they often require large sample sizes, are limited in the way that statements can vary in location, and (in some cases) require a separate precalibration phase prior to the scoring of forced-choice responses. This dissertation introduces new item response theory models for estimating item and person parameters from rank-order responses indicating preferences among two or more alternatives representing, for example, different personality dimensions. Parameters for this new model, called the Hyperbolic Cosine Model for Rank order responses (HCM-RANK), can be estimated using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods that allow for the simultaneous evaluation of item properties and person scores. The efficacy of the MCMC parameter estimation procedures for these new models was examined via three studies. Study 1 was a Monte Carlo simulation examining the efficacy of parameter recovery across levels of sample size, dimensionality, and approaches to item calibration and scoring. It was found that estimation accuracy improves with sample size, and trait scores and location parameters can be estimated reasonably well in small samples. Study 2 was a simulation examining the robustness of trait estimation to error introduced by substituting subject matter expert (SME) estimates of statement location for MCMC item parameter estimates and true item parameters. Only small decreases in accuracy relative to the true parameters were observed, suggesting that using SME ratings of statement location for scoring might be a viable short-term way of expediting MFC test deployment in field settings. Study 3 was included primarily to illustrate the use of the newly developed IRT models and estimation methods with real data. An empirical investigation comparing validities of personality measures using different item formats yielded mixed results and raised questions about multidimensional test construction practices that will be explored in future research. The presentation concludes with a discussion of MFC methods and potential applications in educational and workforce contexts.},

	abstract = {Multidimensional forced-choice (MFC) questionnaires typically show good validities and are resistant to impression management effects. However, they yield ipsative data, which distorts scale relationships and makes comparisons between people problematic. Depressed reliability estimates also led developers to create tests of potentially excessive length. We apply an IRT Preference Model to make more efficient use of information in existing MFC questionnaires. OPQ32i used for selection and assessment internationally is examined using this approach. The latent scores recovered from a much reduced number of MFC items are superior to the full test‟s ipsative scores, and comparable to unbiased normative scores.},

	abstract = {Through simulated data, five multidimensional computerized adaptive testing (MCAT) selection procedures with varying test lengths are examined and compared using different stopping rules. Fixed item exposure rates are used for all the items, and the Priority Index (PI) method is used for the content constraints. Two stopping rules, standard error (SE) and predicted standard error reduction (PSER), are proposed; each MCAT selection process is stopped if either the required precision has been achieved or the selected number of items has reached the maximum limit. The five procedures are as follows: minimum angle (Ag), volume (Vm), minimize the error variance of the linear combination (V 1), minimize the error variance of the composite score with the optimized weight (V 2), and Kullback–Leibler (KL) information. The recovery for the domain scores or content scores and their overall score, test length, and test reliability are compared across the five MCAT procedures and between the two stopping rules. It is found that the two stopping rules are implemented successfully and that KL uses the least number of items to reach the same precision level, followed by Vm; Ag uses the largest number of items. On average, to reach a precision of SE = .35, 40, 55, 63, 63, and 82 items are needed for KL, Vm, V 1, V 2, and Ag, respectively, for the SE stopping rule. PSER yields 38, 45, 53, 58, and 68 items for KL, Vm, V 1, V 2, and Ag, respectively; PSER yields only slightly worse results than SE, but with much fewer items. Overall, KL is recommended for varying-length MCAT.},

	abstract = {Assessment of noncognitive constructs in organizational research and practice is challenging because of response biases that can distort test scores. Researchers must also deal with time constraints and the ensuing trade-offs between test length and the number of constructs measured. This article describes a novel way of improving the efficiency of noncognitive assessments using computer adaptive testing (CAT) with multidimensional pairwise preference (MDPP) items. Tests composed of MDPP items are part of a broader family of forced choice measures that ask respondents to choose between two or more equally desirable statements in an effort to combat response distortion. The authors conducted four computer simulations to explore the influences of test design, dimensionality, and the advantages of adaptive item selection for trait score and error estimation with tests involving as many as 25 dimensions. Overall, adaptive MDPP testing produced gains in accuracy over nonadaptive MDPP tests comparable to those observed with traditional unidimensional CATs. In addition, an empirical illustration involving a 15-dimension MDPP CAT administered in a field setting showed patterns of correlations that were consistent with expectations, thus showing construct validity.},

The instrument is derived from the five-factor model ( FFM) of personality and encompasses a broad spectrum of personality assessment. This document provides an overview of the assessment, beginning with detailing evidence-based practices for personality measurement and modeling its relationship to workplace outcomes. We address the validity and fairness of this assessment, the creation of composite scores, and the generalizability of the assessment across languages and job types. We conclude with recommendations on the use of this capability for workforce applications and guidelines for future research.},

	abstract = {In this study, the authors consider several indices to indicate whether multidimensional data are “unidimensional enough” to fit with a unidimensional measurement model, especially when the goal is to avoid excessive bias in structural parameter estimates. They examine two factor strength indices (the explained common variance and omega hierarchical) and several model fit indices (root mean square error of approximation, comparative fit index, and standardized root mean square residual). These statistics are compared in population correlation matrices determined by known bifactor structures that vary on the (a) relative strength of general and group factor loadings, (b) number of group factors, and (c) number of items or indicators. When fit with a unidimensional measurement model, the degree of structural coefficient bias depends strongly and inversely on explained common variance, but its effects are moderated by the percentage of correlations uncontaminated by multidimensionality, a statistic that rises combinatorially with the number of group factors. When the percentage of uncontaminated correlations is high, structural coefficients are relatively unbiased even when general factor strength is low relative to group factor strength. On the other hand, popular structural equation modeling fit indices such as comparative fit index or standardized root mean square residual routinely reject unidimensional measurement models even in contexts in which the structural coefficient bias is low. In general, such statistics cannot be used to predict the magnitude of structural coefficient bias.},

	abstract = {Forced-choice questionnaires have been proposed as a way to control some response biases associated with traditional questionnaire formats (e.g., Likert-type scales). Whereas classical scoring methods have issues of ipsativity, item response theory (IRT) methods have been claimed to accurately account for the latent trait structure of these instruments. In this article, the authors propose the multi-unidimensional pairwise preference two-parameter logistic (MUPP-2PL) model, a variant within Stark, Chernyshenko, and Drasgow’s MUPP framework for items that are assumed to fit a dominance model. They also introduce a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) procedure for estimating the model’s parameters. The authors present the results of a simulation study, which shows appropriate goodness of recovery in all studied conditions. A comparison of the newly proposed model with a Brown and Maydeu’s Thurstonian IRT model led us to the conclusion that both models are theoretically very similar and that the Bayesian estimation procedure of the MUPP-2PL may provide a slightly better recovery of the latent space correlations and a more reliable assessment of the latent trait estimation errors. An application of the model to a real data set shows convergence between the two estimation procedures. However, there is also evidence that the MCMC may be advantageous regarding the item parameters and the latent trait correlations.},

	abstract = {This paper calls into question traditional methods of measuring the social desirability of items and their use in scale construction. First, we make explicit that the proper focus for desirability studies of items and traits are the rated desirabilities of the alternative item responses indicating different trait levels. Second, the results from our first study show that the relation between degree of endorsement of an item and its judged desirability level is often nonlinear and varies across items such that no general model of item desirability can be adopted that will accurately represent the relations across all items, traits, and trait levels. In addition, the nature of these relationships can vary depending on whether desirability is considered in a work or general context. Third, results from a second study indicate specifically that people when instructed to self-present in a maximally desirable manner will choose for some attributes a moderate level of endorsement (e.g., “agree”) rather than a more extreme response option (e.g., “strongly agree”). Subjects offer several different reasons for viewing the less extreme response options, which yield more moderate trait level scores, as more desirable. These reasons are linked to perceptions of the more extreme response option as being associated with negative behaviors and concerns about how others will view a more extreme response to the item. Both studies indicate that desirable responding to personality items is more complex than previously believed.},

	abstract = {Response styles are a source of contamination in questionnaire ratings, and therefore they threaten the validity of conclusions drawn from marketing research data. In this article, the authors examine five forms of stylistic responding (acquiescence and disacquiescence response styles, extreme response style/response range, midpoint responding, and noncontingent responding) and discuss their biasing effects on scale scores and correlations between scales. Using data from large, representative samples of consumers from 11 countries of the European Union, the authors find systematic effects of response styles on scale scores as a function of two scale characteristics (the proportion of reverse-scored items and the extent of deviation of the scale mean from the midpoint of the response scale) and show that correlations between scales can be biased upward or downward depending on the correlation between the response style components. In combination with the apparent lack of concern with response styles evidenced in a secondary analysis of commonly used marketing scales, these findings suggest that marketing researchers should pay greater attention to the phenomenon of stylistic responding when constructing and using measurement instruments.},

No evidence of a major social desirability factor but relatively substantial (effect sizes above 0.20) country and Country x Gender differences in response styles were found. These styles tended to correlate with scores on the academic rather than nonacademic self-esteem scales. This result may be due to participants with higher academic ability being more able to cope with the cognitive task of interpreting and answering consistently the items of the SDQ-1. Interpretations in terms of cultural dimensions such as individualism-collectivism were considered.},

	abstract = {In forced-choice questionnaires, respondents have to make choices between two or more items presented at the same time. Several IRT models have been developed to link respondent choices to underlying psychological attributes, including the recent MUPP (Stark et al. in Appl Psychol Meas 29:184-203, 2005 ) and Thurstonian IRT (Brown and Maydeu-Olivares in Educ Psychol Meas 71:460-502, 2011 ) models. In the present article, a common framework is proposed that describes forced-choice models along three axes: (1) the forced-choice format used; (2) the measurement model for the relationships between items and psychological attributes they measure; and (3) the decision model for choice behavior. Using the framework, fundamental properties of forced-choice measurement of individual differences are considered. It is shown that the scale origin for the attributes is generally identified in questionnaires using either unidimensional or multidimensional comparisons. Both dominance and ideal point models can be used to provide accurate forced-choice measurement; and the rules governing accurate person score estimation with these models are remarkably similar.},

These increasingly pervasive and often countertheoretical findings permeate levels of analysis (i.e., from micro to macro) and management subfields (e.g., organizational behavior, strategic management). Although seemingly unrelated, the authors contend that this body of empirical research can be accounted for by a meta-theoretical principle they call the too-much-of-a-good-thing effect (TMGT effect). The authors posit that, due to the TMGT effect, all seemingly monotonic positive relations reach context-specific inflection points after which the relations turn asymptotic and often negative, resulting in an overall pattern of curvilinearity. They illustrate how the TMGT effect provides a meta-theoretical explanation for a host of seemingly puzzling results in key areas of organizational behavior (e.g., leadership, personality), human resource management (e.g., job design, personnel selection), entrepreneurship (e.g., new venture planning, firm growth rate), and strategic management (e.g., diversification, organizational slack). Finally, the authors discuss implications of the TMGT effect for theory development, theory testing, and management practice.},

Therefore, the present study sought to provide a meta-analytic estimate of the criterion-related validity of explicit Big 5 measures for predicting job performance and contextual performance. The results for job performance closely paralleled 2 of the previous meta-analyses, whereas analyses with contextual performance showed more complex relations among the Big 5 and performance.

	abstract = {As we begin the new millennium, it is an appropriate time to examine what we have learned about personality-performance relationships over the past century and to embark on new directions for research. In this study we quantitatively summarize the results of 15 prior meta-analytic studies that have investigated the relationship between the Five Factor Model (FFM) personality traits and job performance. Results support the previous findings that conscientiousness is a valid predictor across performance measures in all occupations studied. Emotional stability was also found to be a generalizable predictor when overall work performance was the criterion, but its relationship to specific performance criteria and occupations was less consistent than was conscientiousness. Though the other three Big Five traits (extraversion, openness and agreeableness) did not predict overall work performance, they did predict success in specific occupations or relate to specific criteria. The studies upon which these results are based comprise most of the research that has been conducted on this topic in the past century. Consequently, we call for a moratorium on meta-analytic studies of the type reviewed in our study and recommend that researchers embark on a new research agenda designed to further our understanding of personalityperformance linkages.},

Results, based on a sample of 254 employees from 50 work groups, showed that safety climate and conscientiousness predicted promotion and prevention regulatory focus, which in turn mediated the relationships of safety climate and Conscientiousness with supervisor ratings of productivity and safety performance. Implications for theory and research on climate, motivation, and performance and avenues for future research are discussed.},

Seventy-three undergraduates made decisions on a series of 75 problems during a 3-hour computerized simulation. Unbeknownst to participants, the rules used in determining correct decisions changed after problems 25 and 50. Effects of the individual differences on decision-making performance became significantly stronger after the changes. Only cognitive ability explained variance in prechange performance. Individuals with higher cognitive ability made better decisions. After the change, the cognitive ability effect increased and the effects of Conscientiousness and Openness became statistically significant. As expected, those with high Openness made better decisions. Unexpectedly, those with low Conscientiousness made better decisions. Subsequent analyses revealed that this surprising effect for Conscientiousness was due to the traits reflecting dependability (i.e., order, dutifulness, deliberation) rather than volition (i.e., competence, achievement striving, self-discipline).},

	abstract = {The Schmid–Leiman (S–L; Psychometrika 22: 53–61, 1957) transformation is a popular method for conducting exploratory bifactor analysis that has been used in hundreds of studies of individual differences variables. To perform a two-level S–L transformation, it is generally believed that two separate factor analyses are required: a first-level analysis in which k obliquely rotated factors are extracted from an observed-variable correlation matrix, and a second-level analysis in which a general factor is extracted from the correlations of the first-level factors. In this article, I demonstrate that the S–L loadings matrix is necessarily rank deficient. I then show how this feature of the S–L transformation can be used to obtain a direct S–L solution from an unrotated first-level factor structure. Next, I reanalyze two examples from Mansolf and Reise (Multivar Behav Res 51: 698–717, 2016) to illustrate the utility of ‘best-fitting’ S–L rotations when gauging the ability of hierarchical factor models to recover known bifactor structures. Finally, I show how to compute direct bifactor solutions for non-hierarchical bifactor structures. An online supplement includes R code to reproduce all of the analyses that are reported in the article.},

For item analysis, marginal trace lines capture the relation with the general dimension while accounting for nuisance dimensions and may prove to be a useful technique for creating short-form tests. This article describes the computations needed to obtain logistic approximations of marginal trace lines for graded response items derived from multidimensional bifactor item response theory (IRT) models. Next, the properties of marginal-trace-line-based likelihoods are evaluated and compared with other bifactor IRT methods. It is noted that for the dimension of interest, the likelihoods computed from marginal item response functions are not equivalent to the conditional likelihoods from the multidimensional IRT model. The authors then propose a method that evaluates the degree of item-level dimensionality and allows for the selection of subsets of items (i.e., short form) that result in scaled scores and standard errors that are equivalent to other multidimensional IRT-based scoring procedures. Finally, a real-data application is provided, which illustrates the utility of logistic approximations of marginal trace lines in the creation of a content-diverse short form.},

	abstract = {The use of increasingly complex statistical models has led to heavy reliance on maximum likelihood methods for both estimation and testing. In such a setting, only asymptotic properties can be expected for estimators or tests. Often there are asymptotically equivalent procedures that differ substantially in computational difficulty and finite sample performance. In a maximum likelihood framework, the Wald, Likelihood Ratio, and Lagrange Multiplier (LM) tests are a natural trio. They all share the property of being asymptotically locally the most powerful invariant tests, and in fact all are asymptotically equivalent. However, in practice, there are substantial differences in the way the tests look at particular models. Frequently when one is very complex, another will be much simpler. Furthermore, this formulation guides the intuition as to what is testable and how best to formulate a model to test it. In terms of forming diagnostic tests, the LM test is frequently computationally convenient as many of the test statistics are already available from the estimation of the null. The application of these tests principles and particularly the LM principle to a wide range of econometric problems is a natural development of the field, and it is a development that is proceeding at a very rapid pace.},

The method therefore permits not only the determination of the type, or organization of traits, to which a particular individual belongs, but also the determination of the number of types necessary for the description of members of a population. Several groups of original data are used to illustrate these uses. In addition, the inverted method may be used to determine the homogeneity or heterogeneity of criteria employed by judges in rating individuals, and is therefore propaedeutic to the normal factor analysis method in most studies of character and personality.

There was a comparatively smaller sample derived from studies at the primary level. Academic performance was found to correlate significantly with Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, and Openness. Where tested, correlations between Conscientiousness and academic performance were largely independent of intelligence. When secondary academic performance was controlled for, Conscientiousness added as much to the prediction of tertiary academic performance as did intelligence. Strong evidence was found for moderators of correlations. Academic level (primary, secondary, or tertiary), average age of participant, and the interaction between academic level and age significantly moderated correlations with academic performance.

Studies on the FC method show this scale is more resistant than other scales to effects of bias. Formats using 4 favorable items, from which the rater chooses the items most characteristic of the person rated, prove superior to other formats. This superiority appears in validities, reliabilities, and preferences of raters using the form. Conditions under which statement indices are obtained should be as similar as possible to conditions under which the final scale will be administered. Combining FC scores with other scale scores yields better results than using either instrument alone. Ample evidence exists that more research can fruitfully be done in the area. (54 ref.)

Nevertheless, there is no definitive agreement on the number of response categories that optimizes the psychometric properties of the scales. The aim of the present work is to determine in a systematic fashion the number of response alternatives that maximizes the fundamental psychometric properties of a scale: reliability and validity. The study is carried out with data simulated using the Monte Carlo method. We simulate responses to 30 items with correlations between them ranging from 0.2 to 0.9. We also manipulate sample size, analyzing four different sizes: 50, 100, 200, and 500 cases. The number of response options employed ranges from two to nine. The results show that as the number of response alternatives increases, both reliability and validity improve. The optimum number of alternatives is between four and seven. With fewer than four alternatives the reliability and validity decrease, and from seven alternatives onwards psychometric properties of the scale scarcely increase further. Some applied implications of the results are discussed.},

In this paper, we investigated the impact by examining findings from 31 published reviews and our own review of 451 articles published in 2009 and 2010. The 32 reviews were divided into two periods: before and after 1999. A total of 116 journals were reviewed. Findings from these 32 reviews revealed that since 1999, the ES reporting has improved in terms of its rate, variety, interpretation, confidence intervals, and fullness. Yet several inadequate practices still persisted: (1) the dominance of Cohen’s d, and the unadjusted R2/η2, (2) the mere labeling of ES, (3) the under-reporting of confidence intervals, and (4) a lack of integration between ES and statistical tests. The paper concludes with resources on Internet and recommendations for improving ES reporting practices.},

The etiology of decades of misuse of statistical tests is explored, highlighting the bad implicit logic of persons who misuse statistical tests. Finally, three revised editorial policies that would improve conventional practice are discussed. The first is the use of better language, with insistence on universal use of the phrase "statistical significance" to emphasize that the common meaning of "significant" has nothing to do with results being important. A second improvement would be emphasizing effect size interpretation, and a third would be using and reporting strategies that evaluate the replicability of results. Internal replicability analyses such as cross validation, the jackknife, or the bootstrap would help determine whether results are stable across sample variations.},

Inattentive respondents provided selfreport data of markedly poorer quality, sufﬁcient to obscure meaningful regression results as well as the effects of experimental manipulations. Screening out inattentive respondents improved statistical power, helping to mitigate the notable drops in power and estimated effect sizes caused by inattention. Ó 2013 Published by Elsevier Inc.},

The estimated mean operational predictive validity of integrity test for predicting supervisory ratings of job performance is .41. Results from predictive validity studies conducted on applicants and using external criterion measures (i.e., excluding self-reports) indicate that integrity tests predict the broad criterion of organizationally disruptive behaviors better than they predict employee theft alone.

Participants were randomly assigned to honest or faking groups. Results support the proposition that when the number of scales is large, the measurement dependency problem associated with the ipsative format is negligible. There was satisfactory convergent validity between ipsative and normative forms in both groups. On both forms, the distance between an ideal profile and participants ratings were narrower in the faking group than in the honest group. The results suggest that though ipsative measures were not completely free from faking, they were relatively more effective in guarding against faking than more commonly used normative measures.},

Quasi-ipsative measures showed substantially higher operational validity coefficients and validity generalization across all occupations than ipsative measures. Results also showed that, compared with the findings of previous meta-analyses, quasi-ipsative personality inventories are better predictors of job performance than previously thought and that operational validities for ipsative measures are notably congruent with past findings. We conclude that quasi-ipsative scale formats are superior for predicting job performance for all occupational groups. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings for personnel selection are discussed in . Practitioner points Personality inventories have been widely used in personnel selection, but it was thought that their predictive validity was small. We found that they are substantially more valid than was previously thought. The traditional opinion among researchers in I/O psychology is that single-stimulus personality inventories (e.g., normative Likert-type scales) have superior predictive validity to FC personality questionnaires (e.g., ipsative inventories), but our research findings suggest that this is not true for quasi-ipsative inventories. In comparison with ipsative and normative personality inventories, quasi-ipsative personality inventories showed higher predictive validity regardless of occupational group. Based on our results, we recommend the use of quasi-ipsative FC personality measures in personnel selection decisions regardless of the occupation group being recruited for.},

The first ACL administered was the regular free response list, followed immediately with a forced-choice version in which the adjectives were arranged into tetrad sets. Ipsative scoring was used and profiles compared. The correlations between the profiles ranged from −1.00 to 1.00, more than 40\% falling in the negative range. Ss gave their impressions and reactions to both inventories, and evaluated the relative validity of the results. A majority favored the free-response technique and felt that it would yield a more accurate description of their self-concepts and personality structures. General consensus was that the forced-choice instructions led to frustration, increased irritability, and decreased motivation. Ss felt that the free-response instrument presented a more relaxing situation and was even enjoyable to take. Ss' verbal reactions were consistent with the statistical results. The findings suggest that the forced-choice method is likely to be inappropriate for use with adjective check lists in self-concept assessment and analysis, and may lead not only to distortion in the personality profiles, but also to reversals.},

	abstract = {This thesis explores item response theory (IRT) in the Personal Profile Analysis (PPA) 
from Thomas International. The study contains two parts (Part 1 and Part II) for which 
two sample groups were collected. For Part I of the research 650 participants were 
collected via the old form (CPPA25/C7) in the Beijing office of Thomas International in 
China (male=323, Female=267, missing=60). Part II of the research used the 
amended form in the same area and collected a sample of 307 (male=185, female=119, 
missing=3). 
The study postulates that IRT methods are applicable to forced-choice psychometrics. 
The results of Part I showed that the current CPPA form functions, to some extent, 
according to PPA’s original constructs. Part I of the research identified 16 items that 
need to be amended (called Amend A in this research). The amended form was 
returned to China for the collection of samples for Part II, and the results are deemed 
acceptable. 
The study concludes with a research protocol for PPA-IRT research generated from the 
current research. The research protocol suggests four levels of analysis for forced 
choice (FC) psychometrics, namely: 1. Textual analysis, 2. Functional analysis, 3. 
Dynamic analysis, and 4. Construct analysis.},

	volume = {1},
	url = {http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2005-07843-001},
	abstract = {The utility of rating scales for predictive purposes or
administrative action has been limited by the ease with
which the rater could determine accurately where he was
placing a person on the scale. When it is known that
administrative action is to be taken on the basis of the
rating, it is not surprising to find markedly negatively
skewed, leptokurtic distributions and low validity
coefficients. It is the purpose of this paper to describe
a technique which reduces the rater's ability to control
the final result of his ratings and to present some typical
results obtained by the method.
The essence of the forced choice technique, as it has
been named, is to force the rater to choose between
descriptive phrases which appear of equal value (have the
same preference index, in our terminology) but are
different in validity (descriminative index). The major
problem is the grouping of alternatives to achieve these
ends.
The forced choice technique involves five major steps:
(1) Procurement of descriptive essays of successful and
unsuccessful persons; (2) preparation of a complete list
of descriptive phrases or adjectives; (3) determination of
preference and discriminative indices for each phrase;
(4) pairing the alternatives so that preference indices are
the same and discriminative indices differ, being negligible
for one alternative; and (5) try-out on a specified
criterion group.
The preference index is the mean of the scale indicating
the degree to which the phrase applies to the group
concerned. When it is the same for two alternatives,
raters in general are equally willing to use either alternative
in describing a person. The discriminative index
represents the correlation of the descriptive phrase and
an overall rating obtained in conjunction with the
descriptive list, (2) above.},

	abstract = {We introduce a novel, regression-based moderation framework to model faking effects that incorporates evaluation of faking tendency as a moderator. We also consider how perceived trait desirability may be factored into the framework and provide programming code for applied researchers to utilize the method in their research. Using this framework, we revisit a well-known response format (i.e., forced-choice) to formally evaluate its ability to mitigate the effects of applicant faking as compared to the widely used Likert format. The impetus for the latter evaluation stems from the use of item response theory (IRT) modeling to yield non-ipsative scores from forced-choice measures. We found strong support for the need to incorporate moderating effects of faking tendency and desirability in predicting applicants’ responses. Also, we found that the only substantial difference across formats lies in forced-choice scores yielding a lower mean inflation at high faking values. As a result, forced-choice scores do not outperform Likert scores when selection ratios are used but may be beneficial when cutoff scores are used. Application of the moderation framework presented extends to self-reported construct measures of varied kinds.},

	url = {https://www.psychometricsociety.org/sites/default/files/cito_imps_program_booklet.pdf},
	abstract = {By virtue of their potential to reduce different types of response biases, pairwise preference items are increasingly considered as an alternative over the popular Likert-type items for the measurement of personality traits, motivation, and attitudes. Recent developments in IRT modeling, which allow to extract normative information from pairwise preference data (contrary to traditional scoring which allows for intra-individual comparisons only), have played a key role in this trend, in particular, the Multi-Unidimensional Pairwise Preference (MUPP) model (Stark, Chernyshenko, Drasgow, 2005, Applied Psychological Measurement) and the Thurstonian IRT (TIRT) model (Brown \& Maydeu-Olivares, 2011, Educational and Psychological Measurement). Our research group has recently shown that replacing the ideal point model for single stimuli in the MUPP framework by a dominance (viz., the 2PL) model, comes down to a reparametrization of the TIRT model. Based on the implied mathematical equivalence, this paper focuses on identification issues (i.e., indeterminacies) in both models. In particular, it is explored to what extent constraints applied in the framework of TIRT relate to MUPP models. Such a comparison may have implications for the extension of the MUPP framework to forced-choice items that contain more than two components/stimuli.},
